Hello and welcome to clinicatools...
ClinicaTools is just an amateur project I working on under my blog clinicalens.
This is where I would be adding cool tools used in healthcare sector collectively in one place so you dont have to visit multiple sites for your needs.
The sole purpose of reason github pages is it is free and easy to use on both server side and client side.
hope this saves u time while providing value.

i will soon update this page with cool graphics
heres [bmi calculator](bmi.html) though
